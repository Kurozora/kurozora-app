[Kurozora](https://kurozora.app) is your go-to platform **discovering**, **sharing** and **tracking** anime and much more! `kurozora-app` is the client side of the Kurozora service. It is designed to be:

# Requirements

An iPhone/iPad running iOS 15+ or a Mac running macOS 12+

# Tools

Kurozora uses a few 3rd party tools to make development as easy and uniform as possible.

##  CocoaPods

We use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) ‚Äî a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects ‚Äî to manage third party libraries.

## SwiftLint

We use SwiftLint to enforce a common style for Swift code. The app should build and work without it, but if you plan to write code, you are encouraged to install it. No commit should have lint warnings or errors.

## R.swift

We use [R.swift](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift) to get strong typed, autocompleted resources like images, fonts and segues.

## Jazzy

We use [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy) to generate [documentation](https://kiritokatklian.github.io/kurozora-app/) for the app. This documentation can also be installed in [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash).
