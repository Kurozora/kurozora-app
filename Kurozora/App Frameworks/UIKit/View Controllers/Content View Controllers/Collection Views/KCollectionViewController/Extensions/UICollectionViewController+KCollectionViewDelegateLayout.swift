	/// Tells your KCollectionViewDelegateLayout the number of columns that should be present in the specified section.
	///
	/// One example of calculating the number of required columns is by deviding the max width of the cell with the total width of the collection view.
	/// - Parameters:
	///    - section: An index number identifying a section in collectionView. This index value is 0-based.
	///    - width: The actual width of the collection view.
	///
	/// - Returns: The number of columns inside the section.

	/// Tells your KCollectionViewDelegateLayout the margins to apply to the background decoration in the specified section.
	///
	/// If you do not implement this method, the layout uses the default value of `NSDirectionalEdgeInsets.zero` instead. Your implementation of this method can return a fixed set of margin sizes or return different margin sizes for each section.
	///
	/// Background decoration insets are margins applied only to the decoration in the section. They represent the distance between the top and the bottom of the decoration and the section it is in. They also indicate the spacing on either side of the items. They do not affect the size of the section and the items themselves.
	///
	/// - Parameters:
	///    - section: The index number of the section whose decoration spacing is needed.
	///    - layoutEnvironment: The layout environment of the specified item.
	///
	/// - Returns: The margins to apply to background decoration in the section.

	/// If you do not implement this method, the layout uses the default value of `NSDirectionalEdgeInsets.zero` instead. Your implementation of this method can return a fixed set of margin sizes or return different margin sizes for each section.
	///
	/// Item insets are margins applied only to the items in the section. They represent the distance between the top and the bottom of the item and the section it is in. They also indicate the spacing on either side of the items (inter-item spacing). They do not affect the size of the section themselves.
	///
	/// - Parameter:
	///    - section: The index number of the section whose inter-item spacing is needed.
	///    - layoutEnvironment: The layout environment of the specified item.
	///
	/// - Returns: The margins to apply to items in the section.

	/// If you do not implement this method, the layout uses the default value of `NSDirectionalEdgeInsets.zero` instead. Your implementation of this method can return a fixed set of margin sizes or return different margin sizes for each section.

	/// Section insets are margins applied only to the items in the section. They represent the distance between the header view and the first line of items and between the last line of items and the footer view. They also indicate the spacing on either side of a single line of items. They do not affect the size of the headers or footers themselves.
	///
	/// - Parameters:
	///    - section: The index number of the section whose insets are needed.
	///    - layoutEnvironment: The layout environment of the specified item.
	///
	/// - Returns: The margins to apply to items in the section.
