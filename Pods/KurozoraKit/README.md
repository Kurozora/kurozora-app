[KurozoraKit](https://developer.kurozora.app/kurozorakit) lets users manage their anime library and access many other serices from your app. When users provide permission to access their Kurozora account, they can use your app to share anime, add anime to their library, and discover any of the millions of anime in the Kurozora catalog. If your app detects that the user is not yet a Kurozora member, you can offer them to create an account within your app.

KurozoraKit is designed to be:

* **üõ† Intuitive:** KurozoraKit is built with Swift, one of the **fast**, **modern**, **safe** and **interactive** programming languages.

* **‚ú® Magical:** The kit is carefully designed to work as efficient and reliable as you would expect it to.

* **üìö Documented:** With up to 100% documentation coverage and more to go.

* **‚öôÔ∏è Reliable:** Built for the best [API](https://github.com/musa11971/kurozora-web). The way KurozoraKit works together with the Kurozora API is truly otherworldly.

# Requirements

KurozoraKit has been tested to work on iOS 12.0+ and macOS 10.15+.  It also works best with Swift 5.0+

To use KurozoraKit in your project, you need to install it first.

## Installation

KurozoraKit is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'KurozoraKit'
```

## Usage
KurozoraKit can be implemented using one line in the `global` scope.

```swift
let kurozoraKit = KurozoraKit()
```

KurozoraKit also accepts a `KKServices` object to enable and manage extra functionality. For example to manage Keychain data and enable built-in HUD alerts you can do something like the following:

```swift
// Prepare Keychain with your desired setting.
let appIdentifierPrefix = Bundle.main.infoDictionary?["AppIdentifierPrefix"] as! String
let keychain = Keychain(service: "AppName", accessGroup: "\(appIdentifierPrefix)com.company.shared").synchronizable(true).accessibility(.afterFirstUnlock)

// Pass the keychain object and enable built-in alerts.
let services = KKServices(keychain: keychain, showAlerts: true)

// Pass KKService
let kurozoraKit = KurozoraKit(authenticationKey: "bearer-token").services(services)
```

You can also be chain desired methods instead of passing data as parameter.

```swift
let services = KKServices().showAlerts(false).keychainDefaults(keychain)
let kurozoraKit = KurozoraKit().authenticationKey("bearer-token").services(services)
```

After setting up KurozoraKit you can use an API by calling its own method. For example, to get the explore page data, you do the following:

```swift
let genreID = 1

kurozoraKit.getExplore(genreID) { result in
	switch result {
	case .success(let success):
		// Handle success case‚Ä¶
	case .failure(let error):
		// Handle error case‚Ä¶
	}
}
```
