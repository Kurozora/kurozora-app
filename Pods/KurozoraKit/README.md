 [KurozoraKit](https://developer.kurozora.app/kurozorakit) lets users manage their anime, manga, games and music library and access many other services from your app. When users provide permission to access their Kurozora account, they can use your app to share anime, add it to their library, and discover any of the thousands of content in the Kurozora catalog. If your app detects that the user is not yet a Kurozora member, you can offer them to create an account within your app.

KurozoraKit is designed to be:

* **🛠 Intuitive:** KurozoraKit is built with Swift, one of the **fast**, **modern**, **safe** and **interactive** programming languages.

* **🧵 Asynchronous:** By utilizing the power of Swift Concurrency, KurozoraKit is more readable and less prone to errors like data races and deadlocks by design.

* **✨ Magical:** The kit is carefully designed to work as efficient and reliable as you would expect it to.

* **📚 Documented:** With up to 100% documentation coverage.

* **⚙️ Reliable:** Built for the best [API](https://github.com/kurozora/kurozora-web). The way KurozoraKit works together with the Kurozora API is truly otherworldly.

# Requirements

KurozoraKit has been tested to work on iOS 15.0+ and macOS 12+. It also works best with Swift 5.0+

To use KurozoraKit in your project, you need to install it first.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

KurozoraKit is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'KurozoraKit'
```

### Swift Package Manager

KurozoraKit is also available through [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager). To install it, simply add the package through Xcode. Go to `File > Add Package Dependencies...` and enter the following URL:

```text
https://github.com/Kurozora/KurozoraKit.git
```

Alternatively you can add the following line to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
	.package(url: "https://github.com/Kurozora/KurozoraKit.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

## Usage
KurozoraKit can be implemented using one line in the `global` scope.

```swift
let kurozoraKit = KurozoraKit()
```

KurozoraKit allows you to set your own API endpoint. For example, if you have a custom API endpoint for debugging purposes, you can set it like this:

```swift
let kurozoraKit = KurozoraKit(apiEndpoint: .custom("https://kurozora.debug/api/"))
```

KurozoraKit also accepts a `KKServices` object to enable and manage extra functionality. For example to manage Keychain data you can do something like the following:

```swift
// Prepare Keychain with your desired setting.
let appIdentifierPrefix = Bundle.main.infoDictionary?["AppIdentifierPrefix"] as! String
let keychain = Keychain(service: "AppName", accessGroup: "\(appIdentifierPrefix)com.company.shared").synchronizable(true).accessibility(.afterFirstUnlock)

// Pass the keychain object.
let services = KKServices(keychain: keychain)

// Pass KKService
let kurozoraKit = KurozoraKit(authenticationKey: "bearer-token").services(services)
```

You can also be chain desired methods instead of passing data as parameter.

```swift
let services = KKServices().keychainDefaults(keychain)
let kurozoraKit = KurozoraKit()
	.authenticationKey("bearer-token")
	.services(services)
```

After setting up KurozoraKit you can use an API by calling its own method. For example, to get the explore page data, you do the following:

```swift
let genreID = 1

kurozoraKit.getExplore(genreID) { result in
	switch result {
	case .success(let success):
		// Handle success case…
	case .failure(let error):
		// Handle error case…
	}
}
```
