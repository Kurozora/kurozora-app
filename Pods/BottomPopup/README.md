## How is it set up?

**Using CocoaPods (Recommended)**

Add below line to your Podfile;

```
pod 'BottomPopup'
```

Then you can install it with pod install command.

**Manual**

Download the project, just drag and drop classes under **BottomPopupController** file to your project.

## How is it used?

After install, simply make your view controller subclass of **BottomPopupViewController.**  

For navigation controllers, it works exactly in same way, make your navigation controller subclass of **BottomPopupNavigationController.**

Congratulations, your view controller is ready to show ðŸŽ‰

Then you can present your controller with native **presentViewController:animated:completion:** method, bottom popup controller will handle rest.

## Customization

Bottom popup comes with couple of customizable properties. Since your view controller subclass of BottomPopupViewController now, **you can override following methods in your view controller** to change behaviour;

* **_shouldPopupDismissInteractivelty() -> Bool_**
  
  Determines your popup should dismiss whether interactively or not. If it is set to yes, user can dismiss popup with pulling down it down. Default is YES
* **_getPopupHeight() -> CGFloat_**
  
  Height value. Default is 377 pt. For example you can return UIScreen.main.bounds.size.height to give it full screen height.
* **_getPopupTopCornerRadius() -> CGFloat_**
  
  Corner radius of popup. Default is 10pt
* **_getPopupPresentDuration() -> Double_**
   
   Present animation duration. Default is 0.5 sec
* **_getPopupDismissDuration() -> Double_**
   
   Dismiss animation duration. Default is 0.5 sec

* **_getDimmingViewAlpha() -> CGFloat_**
   
   Target alpha value of the black-colored dimming view after present animation. Default is 0.5
   
   You can see how changing of these properties changes popup's behaviour below.

func bottomPopupViewLoaded()
func bottomPopupWillAppear()
func bottomPopupDidAppear()
func bottomPopupWillDismiss()
func bottomPopupDidDismiss()
func bottomPopupDismissInteractionPercentChanged(from oldValue: CGFloat, to newValue: CGFloat)
